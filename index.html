        <h2>Game Play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the pockets on his/her side.</li>
            <li>Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each pocket until the stones run out.</li>
            <li>If you run into your own Mancala (store), deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's Mancala, skip
                it and continue moving to the next pocket.</li>
            <li>If the last piece you drop is in your own Mancala, you take another turn.</li>
            <li>If the last piece you drop is in an empty pocket on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the
                pocket directly opposite.</li>
