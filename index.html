        <h2>Game Play</h2>
            <h4>The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the pockets on his/her side.</h4>
            <h4>Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each pocket until the stones run out.</h4>
            <h4>If you run into your own Mancala (store), deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's Mancala, skip
                it and continue moving to the next pocket.</h4>
            <h4>If the last piece you drop is in your own Mancala, you take another turn.</h4>
            <h4>If the last piece you drop is in an empty pocket on your side, you capture that piece and any pieces in the
                pocket directly opposite.</h4>
